          <p>
          Mental health refers to our emotional, psychological, and social
          well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act, and helps
          determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.
          Taking care of your mental health is just as important as caring for
          your physical health.

          <p>
          Stress is a natural response to challenging or demanding situations.
          It can motivate us to take action, but too much stress can negatively
          impact our mental and physical health. Common sources of stress
          include work, school, relationships, and major life changes.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Short-term stress can help you focus and perform under pressure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Long-term or chronic stress can lead to anxiety, depression, and
            other health problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Recognizing your stress triggers and learning healthy coping
            strategies is important.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If stress feels overwhelming, consider talking to someone you trust or
          seeking professional support.
        </p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 ">
          <h2 id="having-issues">What to Do If You Think You're Having Issues</h2>
          <p>
          If you feel like you may be experiencing mental health challenges,
          remember that you are not alone and help is available. Here are some
          steps you can take:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Talk to someone you trust, such as a friend, family member, or
            teacher.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reach out to a healthcare professional for advice and support.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consider contacting a mental health helpline or support service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Practice self-care by getting enough sleep, eating well, and staying
            active.
          </li>
          <li>
            Try relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or gentle
            exercise.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Seeking help is a sign of strength. Early support can make a big
          difference in your well-being.
